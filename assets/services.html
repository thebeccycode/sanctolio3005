            <h3><strong>Services</strong></h3>

            <p>Our business offers digital services from website building to running your social media business pages.
                Below are the services and the prices you can expect to pay for them:</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Logo Design</h3>
            <h6>£100</h6>
            <p>We will work with you to design and create a logo that is perfect for your company. Whether you already
                know what you want, or you don't, we will make sure that you are proud to display your brand new logo
                that you can trademark.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Website Design</h3>
            <h6>£50</h6>
            <p>Although this is part of the web development process, it is necessary that this is a separate service to
                website development. if you already have your own wireframe, you will not need to pay this. It is a
                relatively quick process once you have picked your 'Elements' from our Client Guide, but if you recieve
                the prototype and are not happy with it, we can tweak it at no extra cost. A complete re-do will incur
                another £50 charge.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Website Development</h3>
            <h6>£500 - £1000 ◆ <em> 30% deposit required</em></h6>
            <p>This price is inclusive of hosting and domain name fees and depends on the size of the website you
                require. This process can take between 4-12 weeks depending on the size of the website you require. You
                will be able to see previews of your website as it reaches different milestones so that you can make any
                design changes as you go along.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Social Media Marketing</h3>
            <p>In order to post, you will need to provide content and updates which we will ask for once a week. You
                decide how much you want us to post and interact. </p>
            <h6>Brand Packages ⪢ £150 </h6>
            <p>This includes a logo design, post templates, post elements and colour palette creation.</p>
            <h6>Social Media Set Up ⪢ £80 </h6>
            <p>This is for the time it takes to set up the social media platforms and promote them. </p>
            <h6>Multi-Platform Post ⪢ £25 per post</h6>
            <p>This means that 1 post is shared across all platforms e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Reels, TikTok etc.</p>
            <h6>Social Media Admin ⪢ £30 per week </h6>
            <p>This means that I will be monitoring and replying to your customers in a timely manner and making sure to
                signpost them back to you. This is optional, but some clients find this service helps them free up their
                own time.</p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <h3>Payment Plans</h3>
            <p>We want to help you out if you're a new business and you don't want to fork out so much money at once.
                Therefore we offer payment plans with website design and development. This is something to discuss at
                the initial appointment.</p>
